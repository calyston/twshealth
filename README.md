## Personal Learnings

This project was an opportunity to apply the UX/UI design skills that I had learnt previously and put them to practical use, as I would be building the website as well. I researched website designs and asked the client for their feedback, agreed on a style, with the client providing colours and typography. From there using Adobe XD I created a style tile, wireframes, and the final design for the 'Free Workout Plan' landing page, which would be online first. I then went on to develop the website using PHP, WordPress, SASS, HTML, and JavaScript.
